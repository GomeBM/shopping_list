This is a small homework assignment we got, the assignment was to build an android shopping list app in Java.
The app uses firebase to store users data.
It has a main activity and three fragments, one for registering a new user, one for logging in and one for displaying a specific user's page which holds it's shopping list which he can store to firebase.
